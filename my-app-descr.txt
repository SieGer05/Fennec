Hi so ny app called FENNEC, is a web absed app:
My project is a security audit system for multiple services (SSH, Apache, etc.), based on JSON-defined rules. Each rule specifies the directive, expected secure value, severity, description, and a command to check its status on the server. The backend loads these rules, connects to the target machine via SSH, and executes the checks to compare actual configurations against security standards (e.g., CIS benchmarks). This makes audits automated, reproducible, and extendable across different services without hardcoding logic.
so my app create an agent, it display deploy agent, where u should put the agent info ip address, port of ssh, and public key, next it create an agent script with bash, and another file with the hash of the script, then u run the script in ur server, and it start gather info, the page of the agent display how ;uch agent for this version it just support one agent, also, display some info like ip address, name, os, and more,... then u can click to view the audit, where u can see the problem in conf files, some brief info and the reference
what i want now is how to integrate ai? with low ressources cuz i just have 8gb ram, so how ai can be integrated in my app??
